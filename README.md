# Custom Ciphers

This is a collection/implementation of ciphers. The highlight of this repo is the very custom `HybridCipher`. 

This project was started for `Cryptography`, a module in `Y1.2` of the `Cybersecurity` course at `Ngee Ann Polytechnic`.

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BB84_KeyExchange.py`         | Implements the BB84 quantum key exchange protocol simulation.              |
| `KnapsackCipher.py`           | Contains the implementation of the Knapsack cryptosystem cipher.             |
| `RC2Cipher.py`                | Implements the RC2 symmetric encryption cipher.                            |
| `RotatingGridCipher.py`       | Implements the rotating grid (Cardan grille) cipher for obfuscation.         |
| `Rotating_BB84_Knapsack.py`   | **Hybrid cipher combining BB84, rotating grid, and Knapsack encryption methods.** |
| `TwoWayKnapsackWithBB84.py`   | Two-way communication using the Knapsack cryptosystem with BB84 key exchange. |
